 * This purpose of this project was to allow me to calculate 
 * the number of hours I'd obtain during a pay-period at my 
 * job. Because I do not work an even number of hours for each
 * day of the week, I needed a way to quickly calculate the number
 * of hours I worked during a pay period to accurately estimate 
 * my paychecks for budgeting reasons. 
 * 
 * 
 * There are a handful of expansions I plan to make to this project. Here are a few
 *  TODO:
 *  expansions: 
 *      -add a pay-period range
 *      -load directly into excel spreadsheed
 *      -nicer interface w/ user instructions
 *      -holidays - if regular hours during holiday is greater than holiday paid-hours (6 or 8), then subtract, else if regular hours during holi-
 *      day is less than holiday paid-hours (6 or 8), the add differance
 *      -add optional hour field
 *      -add optional tax % field
 *      -add saturday and sunday options
 *      - handle more special (error) cases
